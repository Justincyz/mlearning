# touch-to-tweet
It is very easy to run this program. This program was written on python and all you need to do is to run the get_score.py firstly and run final_score secondly.  Those two python files are written on Python 2.7 not 3.5

1. You need to registe a LIWC account from LIWC website.
2. Copy and paste the key and secret key from LIWC and paste both of them on get_score.py
3. Make sure the Tweet library files (in .txt format) are in the same directory as above two files. 
4. Run the get_score.py, it will generate two JSON libraries in local
5. Run final_score.py, it will run the algorithm and find the best matched pair from those two local JSON files.
